# Meet Anzu

Anzu is our greatest endeavor to build the most rad, simple & reactive forum software out there since the Javascript revolution. 

Forum platforms to host communities are vast. Many would say it's a lifeless space with almost zero innovation, and attempting to create something new is pointless. We dissent, and if you found this repository you might also share with us the idea that there has to be an alternative to the old forum. Well, we think Anzu is that young and sexy software that could bring back to life the community-building movement.

This repository contains the core backend and the frontend submodule link. 
We're still working in the first alpha, so previous knowledge about the stack is required to set things up.
